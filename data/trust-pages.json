      "content": "<p class=\"text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6\">CovertConvert is a free image converter built for people who value their privacy.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4\">Why We Built This</h2>\n<p class=\"text-gray-600 mb-4\">Most image converters upload your files to their servers. That means your personal photos, documents, and images pass through someone else's computers. We thought there had to be a better way.</p>\n<p class=\"text-gray-600 mb-4\">CovertConvert processes everything locally in your browser. Your files never leave your device. There's no upload button because there's nothing to upload to.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4\">How It Works</h2>\n<p class=\"text-gray-600 mb-4\">We use modern web technologies like WebAssembly to run image conversion code directly in your browser. It's like installing software, but without the install. Your browser does all the work.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4\">What We Support</h2>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-4 space-y-2\">\n  <li><strong>HEIC/HEIF</strong> - iPhone photos</li>\n  <li><strong>WebP</strong> - Modern web images</li>\n  <li><strong>AVIF</strong> - Next-gen compression</li>\n  <li><strong>TIFF</strong> - Professional photography</li>\n  <li><strong>PNG, BMP, GIF</strong> - Common formats</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"text-gray-600 mb-4\">Convert to JPEG for smaller files or PNG for lossless quality.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4\">No Limits, No Catches</h2>\n<p class=\"text-gray-600 mb-4\">Because we don't run servers to process your files, we don't have server costs to cover. That means genuinely unlimited conversions. No daily limits. No file size restrictions. No premium tier upsells.</p>"

      "content": "<p class=\"text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6\">We don't collect your files because we never receive them.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4\">The Short Version</h2>\n<p class=\"text-gray-600 mb-4\">Your images are converted entirely in your browser. They never leave your device. We couldn't see them even if we wanted to.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4\">What We Don't Collect</h2>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-4 space-y-2\">\n  <li>Your files (we never receive them)</li>\n  <li>Your personal information</li>\n  <li>User accounts (we don't have any)</li>\n  <li>Passwords (none to store)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4\">What We Do Collect</h2>\n<p class=\"text-gray-600 mb-4\">We use Google Analytics to understand how people use the site. This includes:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-4 space-y-2\">\n  <li>Pages visited</li>\n  <li>General location (country/city level)</li>\n  <li>Device type and browser</li>\n  <li>Conversion events (that you started/completed a conversion - not the files themselves)</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"text-gray-600 mb-4\">This data is anonymous and helps us improve the site.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4\">Cookies</h2>\n<p class=\"text-gray-600 mb-4\">We only use cookies for Google Analytics. No tracking cookies, no advertising profiles, no third-party data sharing beyond basic analytics.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4\">Verify It Yourself</h2>\n<p class=\"text-gray-600 mb-4\">Don't take our word for it. Open your browser's developer tools (F12), go to the Network tab, and convert a file. You'll see that nothing is uploaded. The only network requests are for loading the page itself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-sm text-gray-500 mt-8\">Last updated: December 2024</p>"

Even if they promise to delete them, you have no way to verify that.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4\">Our Approach: Everything Stays Local</h2>\n<p class=\"text-gray-600 mb-4\">CovertConvert works differently:</p>\n<ol class=\"list-decimal list-inside text-gray-600 mb-4 space-y-2\">\n  <li>You select files (they stay on your device)</li>\n  <li>Your browser reads and converts them locally</li>\n  <li>Converted files download directly from your browser</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"text-gray-600 mb-4\">No upload. No server processing. No trust required.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4\">The Technology Behind It</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-medium text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3\">WebAssembly (WASM)</h3>\n<p class=\"text-gray-600 mb-4\">WebAssembly lets us run high-performance code directly in your browser. We use it for formats like HEIC and AVIF that browsers can't natively decode. The conversion libraries (libheif for HEIC, Squoosh codecs for AVIF) run entirely client-side.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-medium text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3\">Canvas API</h3>\n<p class=\"text-gray-600 mb-4\">For encoding output (JPEG, PNG), we use the browser's built-in Canvas API. This is standard web technology that's been available for over a decade.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-medium text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3\">Blob URLs</h3>\n<p class=\"text-gray-600 mb-4\">Converted files are created as Blob objects in memory and downloaded via temporary URLs. These exist only in your browser session and are cleaned up automatically.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4\">Verify It Yourself</h2>\n<p class=\"text-gray-600 mb-4\">You don't have to trust us. Here's how to verify:</p>\n<ol class=\"list-decimal list-inside text-gray-600 mb-4 space-y-2\">\n  <li>Open Developer Tools (F12 or right-click → Inspect)</li>\n  <li>Go to the <strong>Network</strong> tab</li>\n  <li>Convert a file</li>\n  <li>Watch the network requests</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"text-gray-600 mb-4\">You'll see requests for the page assets (HTML, CSS, JS, WASM codecs), but <strong>no outgoing requests containing your file data</strong>. The conversion happens entirely in your browser.</p>\n\n<div class=\"bg-gray-100 rounded-lg p-6 mt-8\">\n  <h3 class=\"text-lg font-medium text-gray-800 mb-3\">For the Security-Conscious</h3>\n  <p class=\"text-gray-600 mb-2\">Filter the Network tab by \"fetch\" or \"xhr\" to see only data requests. During conversion, you'll see zero outgoing data requests. The only traffic is loading static assets.</p>\n  <p class=\"text-gray-600\">This architecture means CovertConvert works in environments where other converters are blocked - including corporate networks, healthcare systems, and legal firms where data can't leave the premises.</p>\n</div>"
