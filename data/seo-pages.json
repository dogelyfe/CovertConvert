          "q": "What is a HEIC file?",
          "a": "HEIC (High Efficiency Image Container) is Apple's default photo format since iOS 11. It offers better compression than JPG while maintaining image quality, but isn't compatible with Windows and many apps."
        },
        {
          "q": "Why can't I open HEIC files on my computer?",
          "a": "Windows doesn't natively support HEIC files. While you can install codec packs, converting to JPG is often simpler and ensures your photos work everywhere."
        },
        {
          "q": "Does this converter upload my photos?",
          "a": "No. All conversion happens in your browser using WebAssembly. Your photos never leave your device. You can verify this by checking the Network tab in your browser's developer tools."
        },
        {
          "q": "What quality is the converted JPG?",
          "a": "By default, we use 92% quality which balances file size and image quality. You can adjust this using the quality slider before converting."
        },
        {
          "q": "Can I convert multiple HEIC files at once?",
          "a": "Yes! Select or drag multiple files and they'll all be converted. On desktop, you'll get a ZIP file. On mobile, files download one at a time."

        {
          "q": "When should I choose PNG over JPG?",
          "a": "Choose PNG when you need lossless quality (no compression artifacts), transparency support, or plan to edit the image further. JPG is better when file size matters."
        },
        {
          "q": "Will converting to PNG preserve my photo quality?",
          "a": "Yes. PNG is a lossless format, so no quality is lost during conversion. The file will be larger than a JPG but with perfect quality preservation."

        },
        {
          "q": "Does this work on iPhone photos with transparency?",
          "a": "iPhone photos don't typically have transparency, but if your HEIC contains transparent elements, they'll be preserved in the PNG output."

          "q": "Why convert WebP to JPG?",
          "a": "JPG is universally supported - every device, app, and website can open it. If you downloaded a WebP image that won't open or upload somewhere, converting to JPG solves the problem."
        },
        {
          "q": "Will I lose quality converting WebP to JPG?",
          "a": "There may be minimal quality loss since JPG is a lossy format, but at our default 92% quality setting, the difference is imperceptible in most photos."
        },
        {
          "q": "Can I convert multiple WebP files at once?",

        },
        {
          "q": "Why is my PNG file larger than the WebP?",
          "a": "PNG is a lossless format while WebP uses compression. The larger file size means no quality is lost - every pixel is perfectly preserved."

          "q": "How does browser-based conversion work?",
          "a": "We use WebAssembly (WASM) to run the AVIF decoder directly in your browser. No server is involved - it's as if you installed converter software, but without the install."
