          "a": "HEIC (High Efficiency Image Container) is Apple's default photo format since iOS 11. It offers better compression than JPG while maintaining image quality, but isn't compatible with Windows and many apps."

        {
          "q": "Will converting to PNG preserve my photo quality?",
          "a": "Yes. PNG is a lossless format, so no quality is lost during conversion. The file will be larger than a JPG but with perfect quality preservation."

          "q": "Will I lose quality converting WebP to JPG?",
