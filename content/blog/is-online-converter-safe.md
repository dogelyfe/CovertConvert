You need to convert an image. You search "HEIC to JPG converter" and click the first result. But should you trust it with your photos?

The short answer: **probably not**—unless you know what to look for.

## How Most Online Converters Work

When you use a typical online converter:

1. You select your file
2. The file uploads to their server
3. Their server processes the conversion
4. You download the result
5. Your file sits on their server... somewhere

That "somewhere" is the problem.

## The Privacy Risks

### Your Files on Someone Else's Computer

When you upload a photo to a converter:
- It travels across the internet
- It's stored on servers you don't control
- Multiple employees may have access
- It may be backed up indefinitely
- It could be used to train AI models

For vacation photos, maybe that's fine. For personal documents, medical images, or anything sensitive? That's a real risk.

### Data Breaches Happen

Even well-intentioned services get hacked. If a converter stores millions of user uploads, it's a target. Your "temporary" upload could end up in a data breach years later.

### Terms of Service Surprises

Read the fine print. Some converters claim rights to uploaded content. Others sell "anonymized" data to advertisers. Most don't delete files immediately—if ever.

## Red Flags to Watch For

**Avoid converters that:**
- Don't have a privacy policy
- Require account creation for basic features
- Ask for more permissions than necessary
- Have vague data retention policies
- Are covered in aggressive ads
- Feel "sketchy" (trust your gut)

## What to Look for in a Safe Converter

### 1. Client-Side Processing

The safest converters don't upload your files at all. They process everything in your browser using JavaScript and WebAssembly.

**How to verify:** Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12), go to the Network tab, and watch what happens when you convert. If your file uploads to a server, you'll see it.

### 2. Clear Privacy Policy

Look for explicit statements like:
- "Files are processed locally"
- "We never upload your files"
- "No data leaves your device"

### 3. No Account Required

If a converter needs your email to convert an image, ask yourself why. Legitimate client-side tools don't need your information.

### 4. Open Source (Bonus)

Open source tools let anyone inspect the code. If a converter claims to be private, open source proves it.

## The Client-Side Difference

Client-side converters work differently:

1. You select your file
2. Your browser reads the file locally
3. JavaScript/WebAssembly processes the conversion
4. You download the result
5. **Nothing ever leaves your device**

The conversion happens entirely on your computer. The website's servers never see your files.

### How CovertConvert Works

[CovertConvert](/) is a client-side converter. When you convert an image:

- Your file stays on your device
- Conversion happens in your browser
- We can't see your files (literally impossible)
- Works offline after the page loads

Don't trust us? Open Developer Tools → Network tab and watch. You'll see zero file uploads.

## When Server-Side Is Okay

To be fair, server-side processing isn't always bad:

**Acceptable uses:**
- Public images with no privacy concerns
- Files you'd share anyway
- Services you trust with clear policies

**Better to avoid for:**
- Personal photos
- Documents with sensitive info
- Medical or financial images
- Anything you wouldn't email to a stranger

## Quick Checklist

Before using any online converter:

- [ ] Does it have a privacy policy?
- [ ] Does it claim client-side processing?
- [ ] Can you verify with Network tab?
- [ ] Does it work without an account?
- [ ] Do reviews mention privacy concerns?

## The Bottom Line

Most online converters upload your files to servers you don't control. That's a privacy risk you don't need to take.

Client-side converters like [CovertConvert](/) prove that convenience doesn't require compromise. Your files never leave your device—and you can verify it yourself.

Convert with confidence. Your photos deserve privacy.
