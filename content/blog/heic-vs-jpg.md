HEIC and JPG are both image formats, but they're built for different eras. JPG has been the standard since 1992. HEIC arrived in 2017 as its modern replacement. Here's how they actually compare.

## The Quick Comparison

| Feature | HEIC | JPG |
|---------|------|-----|
| File size | ~50% smaller | Baseline |
| Color depth | 16-bit | 8-bit |
| Transparency | Yes | No |
| Animation | Yes | No |
| HDR support | Yes | Limited |
| Compatibility | Limited | Universal |
| Year introduced | 2017 | 1992 |

## File Size: HEIC Wins

This is HEIC's headline feature. For the same visual quality:

- A typical 12MP photo: **~2MB as HEIC, ~4MB as JPG**
- A 4K screenshot: **~1MB as HEIC, ~2.5MB as JPG**

Over thousands of photos, this adds up. An iPhone with 128GB storage can hold roughly twice as many HEIC photos as JPG photos.

### Why Is HEIC Smaller?

HEIC uses the same compression technology as H.265/HEVC video. This modern codec is dramatically more efficient than JPG's 30-year-old compression algorithm.

Think of it like comparing a 1992 fax machine to a 2024 video codec. There's been a lot of progress.

## Image Quality: HEIC Wins

At the same file size, HEIC produces better images. At the same visual quality, HEIC produces smaller files. You can't lose.

### Color Depth

- **JPG:** 8 bits per channel (16.7 million colors)
- **HEIC:** 16 bits per channel (trillions of colors)

For everyday photos, 8-bit is fine. For photos with subtle gradients (like sunsets or skin tones), 16-bit captures more nuance.

### Wide Color Gamut

HEIC supports the P3 color space used by modern Apple displays. JPG is limited to sRGB. This means HEIC can represent more vivid colors accurately.

### Less Banding

Compression artifacts like "banding" (visible stripes in gradients) are less common in HEIC because of the higher color depth and better compression.

## Features: HEIC Wins

HEIC isn't just a static image format—it's a container that can hold multiple types of data:

### Transparency

HEIC supports alpha channels (transparency), like PNG. JPG doesn't. If you need a transparent background, HEIC can do it while JPG can't.

### Multiple Images

One HEIC file can contain:
- **Live Photos** (video + still)
- **Burst sequences**
- **Image collections**

This is why Live Photos on iPhone are stored as single HEIC files.

### Depth Maps

Portrait mode photos store depth information in the HEIC file. This enables changing the blur after the photo is taken.

### Non-Destructive Edits

iOS stores photo edits as metadata in HEIC files, keeping the original intact. You can always revert to the original.

## Compatibility: JPG Wins (Massively)

Here's where JPG's age becomes an advantage. After 30+ years, JPG support is everywhere:

**JPG works with:**
- Every operating system ever
- Every web browser
- Every photo editor
- Every social media platform
- Every email client
- Every printer
- Every scanner
- Every application that handles images

**HEIC works with:**
- macOS 10.13+ (2017)
- iOS 11+ (2017)
- Windows 10/11 (with codec)
- Some modern Android phones
- Some photo editors
- Some websites

When you need universal compatibility, JPG is the only choice.

## When to Use Each Format

### Use HEIC When:

- Storing photos long-term (smaller, higher quality)
- Staying in the Apple ecosystem
- Storage space is a concern
- You need Live Photos or depth data
- You're not sharing outside Apple devices

### Use JPG When:

- Sharing with others
- Uploading to websites
- Emailing attachments
- Posting to social media
- Maximum compatibility needed
- Working with non-Apple software

## The Best Strategy

Don't choose one or the other. **Use both:**

1. **Keep HEIC as your archive format** - Best quality, smallest size
2. **Convert to JPG when sharing** - Universal compatibility

Your iPhone already does this when you share via AirDrop to non-Apple devices or when you configure "Automatic" transfer mode.

For manual conversions, [CovertConvert](/) handles the conversion in seconds, directly in your browser.

## What About WebP and AVIF?

HEIC isn't the only modern format:

| Format | Support | Pros |
|--------|---------|------|
| HEIC | Apple devices | Best iPhone integration |
| WebP | Chrome, Firefox, Edge | Good for web images |
| AVIF | Newest browsers | Best compression |
| JPG | Everything | Universal compatibility |

For web publishing, WebP is a good modern choice. For personal photos, HEIC (on iPhone) or JPG (everywhere else) are the practical options.

## The Future

Eventually, HEIC (or its successor AVIF) will become as universal as JPG. Compression technology doesn't stand still, and storage/bandwidth savings drive adoption.

Until then:
- Shoot in HEIC for quality
- Convert to JPG for compatibility
- [CovertConvert](/) makes conversion painless

## The Bottom Line

**HEIC is objectively better** for image quality and file size. **JPG is objectively better** for compatibility.

Smart photographers use both: HEIC for storage, JPG for sharing. The 10 seconds it takes to convert is worth preserving both quality and compatibility.
