If you've ever tried to open an iPhone photo on Windows or upload it to a website, you've probably encountered the mysterious `.heic` file extension. What is this format, and why does Apple insist on using it?

## HEIC: The Basics

HEIC stands for **High Efficiency Image Container**. It's based on the HEIF (High Efficiency Image Format) standard, which uses the same compression technology as HEVC video (H.265).

Apple adopted HEIC as the default photo format starting with iOS 11 in 2017. Every photo you take on a modern iPhone is saved as HEIC by default.

## Why Apple Uses HEIC

Apple didn't switch to HEIC just to annoy Windows users. There are genuine technical benefits:

### 1. Smaller File Sizes

HEIC images are typically **40-50% smaller** than equivalent JPEG files while maintaining the same visual quality. On a 128GB iPhone, this translates to thousands of extra photos.

### 2. Better Image Quality

HEIC supports:
- **16-bit color depth** (vs JPEG's 8-bit)
- **Wide color gamut** (P3)
- **HDR images**
- **Transparency** (like PNG)

### 3. Advanced Features

HEIC can store:
- Multiple images in one file (Live Photos, bursts)
- Depth maps for Portrait mode
- Image sequences and animations
- Non-destructive edits

## The Compatibility Problem

Here's the catch: HEIC isn't universally supported.

**Works with HEIC:**
- macOS 10.13+
- iOS 11+
- Windows 10/11 (with codec)
- Modern Android (varies)

**Doesn't work with HEIC:**
- Older Windows versions
- Many websites and web apps
- Older photo editing software
- Email clients (sometimes)
- Social media uploads (sometimes)

You'll see errors like:
- "File format not supported"
- "Cannot open this file"
- "Upload failed"

## How to Convert HEIC to JPG

When you need compatibility, converting HEIC to JPG is the simplest solution. JPG works everywhere.

### Option 1: Use CovertConvert (Recommended)

[CovertConvert](/) converts HEIC to JPG directly in your browser. Your files never leave your device—it's completely private.

1. Go to [CovertConvert](/)
2. Drop your HEIC files
3. Download your JPGs

### Option 2: Change iPhone Settings

You can make your iPhone save photos as JPG instead of HEIC:

1. Open **Settings**
2. Go to **Camera** → **Formats**
3. Select **Most Compatible**

The downside: you lose the storage savings and quality benefits of HEIC.

### Option 3: Install Windows Codec

Microsoft offers [HEIF Image Extensions](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PMMSR1CGPWG) in the Microsoft Store. However:
- Requires Windows 10/11
- May require additional purchase for HEVC codec
- Doesn't help with web uploads

## Should You Keep Using HEIC?

**Yes, keep HEIC as your default.** The storage savings are significant, and quality is better. Just convert to JPG when you need compatibility.

Think of it like this: keep the high-quality HEIC as your "master" and export JPG copies when needed.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | HEIC | JPG |
|---------|------|-----|
| File size | Smaller (~50%) | Larger |
| Color depth | 16-bit | 8-bit |
| Transparency | Yes | No |
| Compatibility | Limited | Universal |
| Quality at same size | Better | Good |

## The Bottom Line

HEIC is technically superior to JPG in almost every way. The only downside is compatibility—and that's easily solved by converting when needed.

Your iPhone photos are stored in the best possible quality. When you need to share them with the rest of the world, [convert them to JPG](/) in seconds.
