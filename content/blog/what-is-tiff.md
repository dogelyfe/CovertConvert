TIFF has been around since 1986. That's almost 40 years. Most file formats from that era are long dead, but TIFF keeps showing up.

## What TIFF actually is

TIFF stands for Tagged Image File Format. It was designed to be a flexible format that could handle different types of image data, color spaces, and compression methods.

The key feature is that TIFF can be lossless—meaning no quality is lost when you save the file. Unlike JPG which throws away some data every time you save it, TIFF keeps everything.

## Where you'll encounter it

**Scanners.** Many scanners default to TIFF output, especially in professional settings. If you've scanned documents at a copy shop or used an office scanner, you might have TIFFs.

**Printing and publishing.** Print shops often want TIFF files because of the lossless quality. If you're preparing images for professional printing, TIFF is common.

**Medical and scientific imaging.** Fields that need exact data preservation often use TIFF. X-rays, microscopy images, satellite imagery.

**Professional photography archives.** Some photographers archive their edited work as TIFF before exporting to JPG for delivery.

**Old files.** If you're digging through old backups or archives, TIFFs from years past aren't uncommon.

## The problem with TIFF

**File size.** TIFF files are huge. A single image can easily be 50-100MB or more. That was fine when the format was mainly used by professionals with dedicated storage. It's annoying when you just want to email something.

**Compatibility.** While TIFF is technically well-supported, many casual applications don't handle it. Web browsers won't display it directly. Some image viewers struggle with it. Social media definitely won't accept it.

**Overkill for most uses.** Unless you need the specific benefits of TIFF (lossless quality, specific color profiles), JPG or PNG will serve you better and be way more convenient.

## When to convert TIFF to JPG

Most of the time, honestly. If you have a TIFF and want to:
- Share it with someone
- Upload it somewhere
- Email it
- View it easily

Converting to JPG makes sense. You'll lose a tiny bit of quality, but for normal viewing it's invisible, and you'll go from a 50MB file to a 2MB file.

[Convert TIFF to JPG](/tiff-to-jpg/) takes a few seconds and makes the file actually usable.

## When to keep TIFF

If you're working in a professional workflow that specifically requires TIFF—printing, publishing, archiving masters—keep the original TIFF. Convert copies when you need to share.

The same advice applies as with HEIC: keep the high-quality original, export to more compatible formats when needed.

## TIFF vs other formats

| Format | Lossless? | File Size | Compatibility |
|--------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| TIFF | Yes | Huge | Professional apps |
| PNG | Yes | Large | Very good |
| JPG | No | Small | Universal |

PNG is often a better choice if you need lossless but also want decent compatibility. But if someone gives you a TIFF, now you know what it is and [what to do with it](/tiff-to-jpg/).
