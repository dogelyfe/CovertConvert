Getting photos off your iPhone onto a Windows PC should be simple. Sometimes it is. Sometimes you end up with files that won't open. Here's how to do it right.

## The transfer methods

**USB cable:** Plug your iPhone into your PC. Open File Explorer, find your iPhone under devices, and copy photos from the DCIM folder. Works reliably but you have to dig through numbered folders.

**iCloud Photos:** If you use iCloud, you can access photos at icloud.com or install iCloud for Windows. Convenient if you're already paying for iCloud storage.

**Email or Messages:** For a few photos, just send them to yourself. Not practical for large batches.

**Third-party apps:** Things like Google Photos or Dropbox. Upload from phone, download on PC. Adds a cloud middleman but works across platforms.

## The HEIC problem

Here's where it gets annoying. iPhones save photos as HEIC files, not JPG. When you transfer via USB, you get the raw HEIC files, and Windows might not open them properly.

You've got two ways to handle this:

**Option 1: Make iPhone convert during transfer**

Go to Settings → Photos → Transfer to Mac or PC → Automatic

Now when you transfer via USB, iPhone will automatically convert HEIC to JPG. This is probably what most people want.

**Option 2: Transfer HEIC, convert on PC**

If you want to keep the original HEIC quality and convert yourself, transfer the files as-is and then [batch convert them to JPG](/).

The second option gives you more control but requires an extra step.

## What about iCloud?

iCloud for Windows has an option to download photos as JPG instead of HEIC. Look in the iCloud settings for "Download to PC" options.

The web interface at icloud.com also converts to JPG when you download.

## My recommended workflow

For most people: Set your iPhone to "Automatic" transfer mode and forget about it. Your photos will arrive as JPGs and just work.

For people who want maximum quality: Transfer HEIC files directly, keep them as your archive, and [convert to JPG](/) when you need to share or use them in apps that don't support HEIC.

## Troubleshooting

**iPhone not showing up in File Explorer?**
- Make sure iPhone is unlocked
- Tap "Trust" if prompted on the phone
- Try a different USB port
- Try a different cable

**Files transferred but won't open?**
- They're probably HEIC. [Convert them](/).
- Or install HEIF Image Extensions from Microsoft Store

**Transfer is slow?**
- USB 2.0 ports are slower. Use USB 3.0 if available.
- Transferring over wifi (AirDrop to Mac, then to PC) might actually be faster for large batches.

## The bigger picture

Apple and Microsoft have been doing their own things for decades, and iPhone-to-Windows will probably never be as smooth as iPhone-to-Mac. But once you understand the HEIC issue and set up automatic conversion, its not too bad.
