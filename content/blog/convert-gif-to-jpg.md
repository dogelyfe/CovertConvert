GIF is one of the oldest image formats still in common use. It's famous for animations, but sometimes you end up with a GIF that's just a regular static image. And static GIFs have some real problems.

## Why GIF is bad for photos

GIF was designed in 1987 for simple graphics. It has some serious limitations:

**256 colors maximum.** That's it. Photos have millions of colors. When you save a photo as GIF, it gets crushed down to 256 colors and looks terrible—banding, dithering, weird artifacts.

**Large file sizes for photos.** GIF compression works well for simple graphics but poorly for photographs. A GIF photo is often larger than the equivalent JPG while looking worse.

**No partial transparency.** GIF has transparency, but it's all-or-nothing for each pixel. No smooth edges.

## When you'd have a static GIF

**Old web graphics.** GIF was the standard for web images before JPG and PNG took over. Old websites, archived content, and legacy graphics are often GIF.

**Screenshots from ancient software.** Some old tools defaulted to GIF export.

**Accidentally saved as GIF.** It happens. Someone hit the wrong format in their image editor.

**Extracted frame from animated GIF.** You wanted one frame from an animation and now have a GIF.

## When to convert GIF to JPG

If you have a static GIF that's actually a photograph or photographic content, [converting to JPG](/gif-to-jpg/) will:

- Usually reduce file size significantly
- Preserve colors better (millions vs 256)
- Make it compatible with more things

Basically, if the GIF isn't animated and doesn't need transparency, JPG is almost always better.

## When to keep as GIF

**It's animated.** Obviously don't convert an animation to static JPG.

**It's simple graphics with solid colors.** Logos, icons, diagrams with flat colors—GIF or PNG is fine.

**You need that specific transparency.** GIF's binary transparency works for some use cases.

## What about PNG?

For static images that need transparency or are simple graphics, PNG is almost always better than GIF. Better compression, more colors, proper alpha transparency.

The only reason GIF persists for non-animated images is legacy content. Nobody chooses GIF for new static images in 2025.

## Converting

If you've got a GIF that should be a JPG, the [conversion is quick](/gif-to-jpg/). The result will probably look better and be smaller. If it's a photo that was incorrectly saved as GIF, you might notice a quality improvement just from having access to full color depth again.
