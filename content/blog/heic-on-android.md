If you've received photos from an iPhone user and they won't open on your Android phone, you've run into HEIC—Apple's photo format that the rest of the world is still catching up to.

## The short answer

It depends on your phone and Android version.

**Newer Android phones (10+):** Usually work fine. Google added HEIC support, and most manufacturers include it.

**Older phones:** Hit or miss. You might be able to view HEIC files but not edit them. Or they might not open at all.

**Third-party apps:** Sometimes help, sometimes don't. Google Photos usually handles HEIC well, while the default gallery app might not.

## Check if your phone supports HEIC

Easiest test: have someone text you a HEIC file and try to open it.

If it opens in your gallery app, you're good. If you get an error or the image looks corrupted, you'll need a workaround.

## Options when HEIC doesn't work

**Option 1: Use Google Photos**

Google Photos is better at handling HEIC than most default gallery apps. If you're getting errors in your phone's built-in app, try opening the file in Google Photos instead.

**Option 2: Ask the sender to convert**

iPhone users can set their phones to auto-convert HEIC to JPG when sharing. In iOS Settings → Photos → Transfer to Mac or PC → Automatic. Then shared photos come out as JPG.

**Option 3: Convert it yourself**

If you've already got the file, [convert it to JPG](/) and move on. Takes about 30 seconds.

## The iPhone to Android photo problem

This mostly comes up when someone sends you photos directly—via email, text, or file sharing. If they're sharing through a social app or cloud service, those usually convert to JPG automatically.

The frustrating part is that iPhones default to HEIC without telling people, so iPhone users often don't know they're sending files that won't open on your phone.

## Bottom line

Modern Android handles HEIC fine. Older Android is a mixed bag. When it doesn't work, converting to JPG is the quickest fix.

If you're the one receiving files that won't open, you can either ask the sender to change their sharing settings or just [convert them yourself](/). Either way, it's a 30-second problem once you know what's happening.
