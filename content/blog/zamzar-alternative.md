Zamzar has been around forever—one of the original online file converters. It handles tons of formats, from documents to videos to images.

But for image conversion specifically, there are some drawbacks worth knowing about.

## Zamzar's limitations

**File size limits:** Free accounts are capped at 50MB per file (used to be 100MB). For video, that's tight. For images, it's usually fine, but if you're converting RAW files or high-res scans you might hit the limit.

**Upload required:** Everything goes to their servers. Your file travels across the internet, gets processed remotely, and the result comes back to you.

**Conversion limits:** Free users get limited conversions per day. They want you to subscribe.

**Email requirement:** They used to require email to download results. Thats changed, but they still push for signups.

## When Zamzar makes sense

If you're converting video, audio, or documents, Zamzar's broad format support is genuinely useful. Processing video locally is hard—server-side makes sense there.

But for images? There's a better way.

## Client-side image conversion

Modern browsers can handle image conversion without any server involvement. WebAssembly and Canvas APIs let you process images entirely on your device.

This means:
- No file size limits (your computer's memory is the limit)
- No upload wait times
- No privacy concerns about where your files go
- No account needed

## How CovertConvert is different

[CovertConvert](/) handles HEIC, WebP, AVIF, TIFF, PNG, BMP, and GIF conversion to JPG or PNG—all locally.

**No limits:** Convert as many files as you want, as large as your browser can handle. No daily caps, no file size restrictions.

**No uploads:** Your files never leave your device. The conversion happens in your browser using WebAssembly.

**No account:** No email, no signup, no tracking. Just convert and go.

## The tradeoff

CovertConvert only does images. If you need to convert a Word doc to PDF or an MP4 to AVI, you'd still need something like Zamzar.

But for image conversion—especially if you're dealing with HEIC from iPhones or WebP from websites—client-side is the right approach.

## Bottom line

Zamzar is fine for document and video conversion where server-side processing makes sense.

For images, [local conversion](/) is faster, more private, and has no restrictions. Different tools for different jobs.
