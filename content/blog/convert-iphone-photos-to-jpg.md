Your iPhone takes great photos. The problem? They're saved as HEIC files, which don't work everywhere. When you need JPG for a website upload, email attachment, or Windows compatibility, here are your options.

## Method 1: Use an Online Converter (Fastest)

The quickest way to convert iPhone photos to JPG is with a browser-based converter.

### Using CovertConvert

1. Transfer photos to your computer (AirDrop, iCloud, cable)
2. Go to [CovertConvert](/)
3. Drop your HEIC files onto the converter
4. Click to download your JPGs

**Pros:**
- Takes seconds
- Batch convert multiple files
- Works on any device with a browser
- No software to install

**Privacy note:** CovertConvert processes files in your browser—nothing uploads to any server. [Learn how we protect your privacy](/blog/is-online-converter-safe/).

## Method 2: Change iPhone Settings (Preventive)

You can make your iPhone save photos as JPG instead of HEIC:

1. Open **Settings**
2. Scroll to **Camera**
3. Tap **Formats**
4. Select **Most Compatible**

Now all new photos save as JPG.

### Also Configure Transfer Settings

Even with HEIC enabled, you can have iPhone auto-convert when transferring:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Photos**
2. Under "Transfer to Mac or PC"
3. Select **Automatic**

This converts to JPG when you transfer to a computer, keeping HEIC on your phone.

**Pros:**
- Set once, forget about it
- No extra steps when sharing

**Cons:**
- JPG files are ~50% larger
- Lose some quality benefits of HEIC
- Doesn't help with existing HEIC photos

## Method 3: Windows Workarounds

If you're on Windows and want to view/edit HEIC files directly:

### Install HEIF Extensions

1. Open Microsoft Store
2. Search "HEIF Image Extensions"
3. Install the free extension
4. Restart your computer

This lets Windows display HEIC thumbnails and open files in Photos app.

**Limitations:**
- Only works in Windows 10/11
- May need additional HEVC codec ($0.99)
- Doesn't help with web uploads

### Use Photos App Export

If you have the codec installed:

1. Open HEIC in Windows Photos
2. Click **...** → **Save as**
3. Choose JPEG format
4. Save

**Cons:**
- One file at a time
- Extra clicks for each photo
- Doesn't work everywhere you need JPG

## Comparison: Which Method to Use?

| Situation | Best Method |
|-----------|-------------|
| Converting a few photos now | Online converter |
| Converting many photos | Online converter (batch) |
| Don't want to deal with HEIC ever | Change iPhone settings |
| Need HEIC features but occasional JPG | Online converter |
| Windows user, viewing only | Install codec |

## Batch Conversion Tips

Have hundreds of HEIC photos? Here's the fastest approach:

1. Transfer all photos to a folder on your computer
2. Go to [CovertConvert](/)
3. Select all files (Ctrl+A / Cmd+A in the file dialog)
4. Convert in one batch
5. Download as ZIP

CovertConvert handles multiple files and packages them in a ZIP for easy download.

## Quality Considerations

When converting HEIC to JPG, there's a quality tradeoff:

- **HEIC:** 16-bit color, smaller files, better quality
- **JPG:** 8-bit color, larger files, universal compatibility

For most purposes, the quality difference is invisible. If you're printing large photos or doing professional editing, keep your HEIC originals and export JPG copies when needed.

### JPG Quality Settings

[CovertConvert](/) lets you adjust JPG quality (10-100%). The default 92% is a good balance of quality and file size. Lower values = smaller files but more compression artifacts.

## Common Questions

**Will converting lose quality?**
Slightly. JPG is a lossy format. But at 92% quality, the difference is imperceptible for normal use.

**Can I convert back to HEIC?**
Technically yes, but you won't regain the lost quality. Keep your HEIC originals.

**Why not just use PNG?**
PNG files are much larger than JPG. Use PNG only when you need transparency.

**Do I need an app?**
No. Browser-based converters work without installing anything.

## The Bottom Line

For most people, using an [online converter](/) when needed is the simplest approach:

- Keep iPhone on HEIC (better storage, better quality)
- Convert to JPG when you need compatibility
- Takes seconds, no settings to change

Your iPhone saves photos in the best format. When the rest of the world catches up to HEIC, you won't need to convert at all. Until then, [CovertConvert](/) has you covered.
