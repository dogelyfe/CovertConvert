If you've ever tried to upload an iPhone photo to some website and got rejected, you've discovered the HEIC problem. Apple saves photos in this format by default, and while it's technically superior to JPG, it doesn't work everywhere.

Here are three ways to deal with it.

## Method 1: Use a browser converter

This is the fastest option when you just need to convert some photos right now.

1. Get your photos onto your computer (AirDrop, iCloud, USB cable, whatever)
2. Go to [CovertConvert](/) (or any converter that processes files locally)
3. Drop your files in
4. Download the JPGs

The whole thing takes maybe 30 seconds. If you've got a bunch of files, most converters will let you do them in batch and give you a zip file.

One thing to watch out for: some converters upload your files to their servers to process them. That's a privacy concern if you're converting personal photos. I wrote more about [how to tell which converters are safe](/blog/is-online-converter-safe/) if you're curious.

## Method 2: Change your iPhone settings

If you want to avoid HEIC entirely, you can tell your iPhone to save photos as JPG from the start.

**To change the format:**
1. Open Settings
2. Scroll down to Camera
3. Tap Formats
4. Select "Most Compatible"

Now your photos save as JPG by default.

**To auto-convert on transfer:**
Even if you keep HEIC, you can have your iPhone automatically convert photos when you transfer them to a computer:
1. Settings → Photos
2. Under "Transfer to Mac or PC"
3. Select "Automatic"

This keeps HEIC on your phone (saving space) but gives you JPGs when you transfer.

**The downside:** JPG files are about twice the size of HEIC, and the image quality is slightly lower. If storage is tight on your phone you'll notice the difference. Also doesn't help with photos you've already taken in HEIC.

## Method 3: Windows codecs

If you're on Windows and just want to be able to view HEIC files, you can install support:

1. Open the Microsoft Store
2. Search for "HEIF Image Extensions"
3. Install it

After a restart, Windows should be able to display HEIC thumbnails and open the files in the Photos app.

Fair warning though—this sometimes requires an additional paid codec (HEVC Video Extensions, $0.99), and it only helps with viewing. If you need to upload somewhere that doesn't accept HEIC, you'll still need to convert.

## Which should you use?

Depends on your situation:

**"I have photos I need to convert right now"** → Browser converter. Takes seconds, no setup required.

**"I never want to deal with HEIC again"** → Change your iPhone settings to Most Compatible. Trades storage space for simplicity.

**"I just want to view HEIC on my Windows PC"** → Install the codec. But know it won't solve every compatibility issue.

Personally I keep my iPhone on HEIC (the storage savings are real) and just convert when I need to. It's become a 30-second task I don't really think about anymore.

## Quick tip for batch conversion

If you're dealing with a lot of photos, select them all at once. Most converters including [this one](/) will process the entire batch and package them into a zip file. Way faster than doing them one at a time.

Also, if you're converting JPG for sharing but want to keep the originals, make sure you're not deleting your HEIC files. They're your highest quality version—keep them as your archive, export JPGs when you need to share with the world.
